## Installation

### Pre-requisities

#### Server Requirements

Laravel 5 system requirementes:

-  PHP >= 5.4
-  Mcrypt PHP Extension
-  OpenSSL PHP Extension
-  Mbstring PHP Extension

As of PHP 5.5, some OS distributions may require you to manually install the PHP JSON extension.. When using Ubuntu, this can be done via `apt-get install php5-json`.

#### Install NodeJS, Bower and Composer

Laravel utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) to manage its dependencies.

You will also need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and then run:

	sudo npm install -g bower
	
to install [Bower](http://bower.io).

### Installation

#### Install the project and the required libraries

* Clone the project.
* `cd private`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* `composer install`

To enhance your IDE's code analysis and auto-completion, run the provided IDE-Helper tool:

	php artisan ide-helper:generate

#### Environment configuration

Duplicate the file `.env.example` at `/private` and name it `.env`. Set the correct values for your environment.

> These values can also be set via system environment variables (ex: via SetEnv on Apache configuration files).

#### Database configuration

You can configure the database driver on `private/config/database.php`.
The database access credentials may be configured on the `.env` file, or trough environmental variables.

The project comes pre-configured for a SQLite database, which requires no configuration.  
To use t, you'll need to create a blank SQLite database.

On the `private` directory, type:

	touch storage/database.sqlite

> **Note:** the SQLite database is excluded from the Git repo, so it will not be included on your commits.

#### Database initialization

To crete the database tables required by the application, just run the provided migrations.

On the `private` directory, type:

	php artisan migrate

#### Additional configuration

Altough, at this point, the application should be fully functional, you may need to perform additional configuration, if you have special requirements.

In that case, read the installation instructions at Laravel's website on the [Configuration](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0#configuration) chapter for more information about the next steps.

#### Test the installation

Finally, load the application on your web browser by specifying the base URL for it.

> ex: http://localhost/~your_username/laravel5-aminLTE, if you're developing on a Mac.

You should see a very simple page with a big title on the center. That is a placeholder page that you can later replace by your application/website's public home page.

To enter the application, click the "Log In" button.

## FAQ

##### Why is the folder structure a little different from the standard Laravel 5 structure?

This slightly modified folder structure is more suitable for deployment on a standard Linux box, as:

* it doesn't pollute the application user's home directory with lots of files and folders,
* the public folder also matches the typical `public_html` folder found on a user's home directory when publishing sites with the Apache web server.
